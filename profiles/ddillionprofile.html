	    <h3>About me:</h3>

        I am always enjoy helping others, and the larger the scale the more an enjoyment it can 
        be. I am very competitive by nature and successfully completing a project that can help
        the world is a motivating challenge. I enjoy video games, music, outdoor activities, 
        and play a lot disc golf with my free time. So if you have a goal or need, feel free
        to toss it my way. I will do everything to see it completed.
		
		<p>
            As the I.T. Executive I continue to help manage and maintainence our site. It 
            is in our best interest to make a clean and easy site for our contibutors so 
            that we may not only feel successful, but successfully help our community. I 
            have gained a lot of experience through my B.S. in Computer Science, and varous
            projects with SQL and C# which help qualify me for my responsibilities.
